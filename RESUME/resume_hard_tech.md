### Research Assistant
**University of Toronto**  
*Sept 2016 - Dec 2022*

My primary Ph.D. research project was the design and construction of a novel >100kV electron accelerator with semiconductor photocathode source - Ultrafast Electron Diffractometer. This complex apparatus probes matter at the atomic scale in ultrafast timescales. I led the planning, design, construction, and other technical work throughout this project.

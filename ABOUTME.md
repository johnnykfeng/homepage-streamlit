* I can build crazy shit with code and with hardware. From 3D printing, vacuum engineering, building laser systems, to writing robust backend services and scalable apps.
* Insatiable curiosity and love to learn new things.
* I never say no to a challenge. Unless it defies the known laws of physics. And trust me, I know a lot of physics ;).
* I'm a big fan of the scientific method and make decisions based on experimental evidence and data.
